# ## Installing Libraries

# We've seen that there are lots of python libraries. But how do we install them?

# The main problem is this: *libraries need other libraries*

# So you can't just install a library by copying code to the computer: you'll find yourself wandering down a tree
# of "dependencies"; libraries needed by libraries needed by the library you want.

# This is actually a good thing; it means that people are making use of each others'
# code. There's a real problem in scientific programming, of people who think they're really clever writing their own
# twenty-fifth version of the same thing.

# So using other people's libraries is good.

# Why don't we do it more? Because it can often be quite difficult to **install** other peoples' libraries!

# Python has developed a good tool for avoiding this: **pip**.

# ### Installing Sci-kit learn using Pip

# On a computer you control, on which you have installed python via Anaconda, you will need to open a **terminal**
# to invoke the library-installer program, `pip`.

# * On windows, go to start->all programs->Anaconda->Anaconda Command Prompt
# * On mac, start *terminal*. 
# * On linux, open a bash shell.

# Into this shell, type:
#     
# `pip install scikit-learn`

# The computer will install the package automatically from PyPI. 

# Now, close the Jupyter notebook if you have it open, and reopen it. Check your new library is installed with:

# In[1]:


from sklearn.datasets import load_wine

wine = load_wine()
X = wine.data
y = wine.target
feature_names = wine.feature_names


# In[2]:


get_ipython().run_line_magic('matplotlib', 'inline')

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))

# Find the column index of two features to plot
color_idx = feature_names.index("color_intensity")
proline_idx = feature_names.index("proline")

# Plot the training points
plt.scatter(X[:, color_idx], X[:, proline_idx], c=y, cmap=plt.cm.bwr, edgecolor="k")
plt.xlabel("Color Intensity")
plt.ylabel("Proline")

plt.xticks(())
plt.yticks(())


# That was actually pretty easy, I hope. This is how you'll install new libraries when you need them.

# Troubleshooting:
#     
# On mac or linux, you *might* get a complaint that you need "superuser", "root", or "administrator" access. If so type:
# 
# * `sudo pip install scikit-learn`
# 
# and enter your password.
#     
# If you get a complaint like: 'pip is not recognized as an internal or external command', try the following:
#         
# * `conda install pip` (Windows)
# * `sudo easy_install pip` (Mac, Linux)
# 
# Ask me over email if you run into trouble.

# ### Installing binary dependencies with Conda

# `pip` is the usual Python tool for installing libraries. But there's one area of library installation that is still awkward:
# some python libraries depend not on other **python** libraries, but on libraries in C++ or Fortran.

# This can cause you to run into difficulties installing some libraries. 
# Fortunately, for lots of these, Continuum, the makers of Anaconda, provide a carefully managed set of scripts for installing
# these awkward non-python libraries too. You can do this with the `conda` command line tool, if you're using Anaconda.

# Simply type
# 
# * `conda install <whatever>`
# 
# instead of `pip install`. This will fetch the python package not from PyPI, but from Anaconda's distribution for your platform, and manage any non-python dependencies too.

# Typically, if you're using Anaconda, whenever you come across a python package you want, you should check if Anaconda
# package it first using this list: http://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/pkg-docs.html. (Or just by trying `conda install` and hoping!) If you can `conda install` it, you'll likely have less problems. But Continuum don't package everything, so you'll need to `pip install` from time to time.

# ### Where do these libraries go? 

# In[3]:


import numpy

numpy.__path__


# Your computer will be configured to keep installed Python packages in a particular place.

# Python knows where to look for possible library installations in a list of places, called the "PythonPath".
# It will try each of these places in turn, until it finds a matching library name.

# In[4]:


import sys

sys.path  # Just list the last few


# ### Libraries not in PyPI

# Sometimes, such as for the Animation library in the Boids example, you'll need to download the source code
# directly. This won't automatically follow the dependency tree, but for simple standalone libraries, is sometimes necessary.

# To install these on windows, download and unzip the library into a folder of your choice, e.g. `my_python_libs`. 
# 
# On windows, a reasonable choice
# is the folder you end up in when you open the Anaconda terminal. You can get a graphical view on this folder by typing: `explorer .`

# Make a new folder for your download and unzip the library there.

# Now, you need to move so you're inside your download in the terminal:

# * `cd my_python_libs`
# * `cd <library name>` (e.g. `cd JSAnimation-master`) 

# Now, manually install the library in your PythonPath using pip:

# * `pip install .`

# This is all pretty awkward, but it is worth practicing this stuff, as most of the power of using programming for
# research resides in all the libraries that are out there.
